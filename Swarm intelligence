Swarm intelligence

Swarm intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial. 
The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence. The expression was introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989,
in the context of cellular robotic systems.[1]

SI systems consist typically of a population of simple agents or boids interacting locally with one another and with their environment. 
The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no
centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between
such agents lead to the emergence of "intelligent" global behavior, unknown to the individual agents. Examples in natural systems of SI
include ant colonies, bird flocking, animal herding, bacterial growth, fish schooling and microbial intelligence.

The application of swarm principles to robots is called swarm robotics, while 'swarm intelligence' refers to the more general 
set of algorithms. 'Swarm prediction' has been used in the context of forecasting problems.
